This repository is a __Marijus Brazickas__ submission for __Getting and Cleaning Data__ course. It has the detailed instructions on how to get __Human Activity Recognition Dataset Using Smartphones__ and run data analysis with the __R__ script.

Dataset: __Human Activity Recognition Using Smarthphones__

Files included:

1.  __CodeBook.md__ that describes variables, data and steps in data transformations

2. __run_analysis.R__ performs the data preparation:

  - merges training and test sets, creates one single set

  - performers the mean and standard deviation on recorded measurements

  - uses specific activity names to label activities on data set

  - labels data set with specific variable names

  - creates independent tidy data set with an average of each variable for each activity and subject

3. __FinalData.txt__ is final data after going through data transformatio steps described above.
