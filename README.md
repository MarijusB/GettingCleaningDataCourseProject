This repository is a __Marijus Brazickas__ submission for __Getting and Cleaning Data__ course. It has the detailed instructions on how to get Human Activity recognition dataset and run the analysis.

Dataset: __Human Activity Recognition Using Smarthphones__

Files:

1.  __CodeBook.md__ that describes variables, data and steps in data transformations

2. __run_analysis.R__ performs the data preparation:

  - merges training and test sets, creates one single set

  - performers the mean and standard deviation on measurements

  - uses specific activity names to name activities on data set

  - labels data set with specific variable names

  - creates independent tidy data set with an average of each variable for each activity and subject

3. __FinalData.txt__ is final data after going through steps described above.
